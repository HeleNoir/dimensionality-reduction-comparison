# Comparison of dimensionality reduction techniques on metaheuristic search process data

If you keep the folder structure as is, the data from the experiment part should be accessible without changing any paths.

Run files from `analysis_scripts` in the following order with specification of the dataset:
convert_log_files.py
prepare_ts_data.py
exploratory_dimensionality_reduction.py


For descriptive statistics and plot of the same datasets, run descriptive_analysis.py
